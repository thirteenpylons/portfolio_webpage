Pete's Background
After graduating college, I became an art teacher and worked with
beginners and professionals. I love art and my works have been
featured in major art galleries across the globe.

If you're looking to hire an artist or if you're an artist looking
for a collaborator for your next project, please reach out! I'm so
excited to work with other artists to create new art.
